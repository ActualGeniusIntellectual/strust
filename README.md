**st Translation Project**


## Project Overview

The `strust` project involves translating the `suckless terminal (st)` program from C to Rust. This initiative is centered around the following key goals:

1. **Learning through Application**: Building an in-depth understanding of application development through the process of translating and adapting an existing, real-world software.

2. **Enhancing Rust Skills**: Improving proficiency in Rust programming in preparation for a career in developing state-of-the-art software in Rust.

3. **Deep Dive into Terminal Technologies**: Gaining a comprehensive understanding of terminal-based technologies with the aim to contribute innovative solutions, potentially integrating the latest advancements in terminal technology into a unified system.

## Approach

**Modular Translation**: The translation of the `suckless terminal` source code in the `strust` project will be conducted in manageable segments, considering the extensive size of the original code.

**Collaborative Assistance**: Seeking assistance in translating specific snippets of C code into Rust and requesting support for various tasks related to the project.

**Progressive Development**: The project will progress in phases, focusing on small, achievable milestones that collectively lead to the complete translation of the terminal program.

## How to Contribute

Contributions to the `strust` project are welcome in the following areas:

**Code Review**: Suggestions for improving the translated Rust code.
**Documentation**: Enhancements to the README or other documentation.
**Testing**: Identifying and reporting any bugs or issues in the translated software.
**Feature Suggestions**: Ideas for new features or improvements.
